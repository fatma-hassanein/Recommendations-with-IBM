# Recommendations-with-IBM

This project is implemented using python and its libraries to build a recommendation system for users using a web portal containing articles. The system contains various techniques for recommendation. This project is powered by IBM as a source of the dataset and done for Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.

## Content

The notebook  is divided to 5 parts which can simulate the advancements made with every used recommendation technique.

- Part I : Exploratory Data Analysis: Provide some insight into the descriptive statistics of the data.
- Part II: Rank-Based Recommendations: Recommendation of articles based on their interactions.
- Part III: User-User Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommendations of articles based on their interaction in addition to the user-article interactions similarities.
- Part V: Matrix Factorization: Applying the SVD technique and measuring its accuracy by splitting the created user-article matrix to training and testing dataframes.

## Conclusion

The results correlated with the visualizations and findings are available in my Recommendations_with_IBM.html file inside this repo.
